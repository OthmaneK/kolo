<h1>Sustainability:the why & how?</h1>
<p>
	Nowadays, our world is facing tremendous challenges threatening our existence, “Humanity has officially consumed more than Earth can produce this year” warns the Global Footprint Network back in 2017. Industrial corporations play a major role in this destructive process, so as our dangerous and irresponsible consumption of world’s resources. “We are mostly consumers rather than consumerists”, that’s unfortunate. Therefore, the urge to turn sustainable and be aware of our habits has become inevitable. 
	We are deeply dedicated to diminish our ecological footprint by supporting Moroccan cooperatives working tirelessly to gain a decent living through sustainably made products and esthetically beautiful, original and traditional items.
